\section{Planning and Prototyping} % PoC
\def \kapitelautor {Erik Ritschl}

Our work already began in the summer of 2015. Since Python was a new language to all of us, and we had especially little experience with wxPython and GUI programming in general, we decided this was the best time to acquaint ourselves with these topics. So we read and watched many tutorials on the Internet, until we felt comfortable about carrying out a project with them.

A mini-prototype was also created, as a proof of concept. It had a very minimalistic graphical user interface, and was capable of the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Read tags from a database file
	\item Read relations between tags and files
	\item Create folders for tags
	\item Create symbolic links in these folders that point to the according file
\end{itemize}

In this phase, another feature was also planned, as a must-requirement even, that had to be dropped. The software was supposed to be able to save tags not only in the central database file, but also in the meta information of the file itself. Attempts have been made at implementing this functionality, first with EXIF, then IPTC and lastly XMP (all different kinds of meta data, where the first two only work with images and the last one with all files). But it quickly became evident during development of the prototype that there is no easy way to modify meta data with Python on all the platforms that we support (Windows, OS X and Ubuntu).
\paragraph{}
After the summer holidays had ended, the team sat together and decided upon the exact features the software should have. These were then formulated as user stories and together composed the product backlog. Soon after that, a method called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker}{Planning Poker} was used in order to decide how many points each user story should be assigned. These points are used to describe the complexity of a user story, and help estimating the total time a task needs in order to be completed.

\paragraph{}
With the completion of the product backlog, the next logical step was to develop a paper prototype. A section of the frontend was assigned to each team member, who subsequently drew sketches with a pen and paper. These were then discussed with the team, and the process was repeated until everyone was happy with the end result.
