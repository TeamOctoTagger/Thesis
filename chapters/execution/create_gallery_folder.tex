\subsection{Create/Edit gallery folder}
\def\kapitelautor{Erik Ritschl}

Just like with the output folders, this section combines two modules for creating and editing gallery folders.

The dialog for gallery folders is a little more complex. Besides the name, location and symlink type, it provides options for the contents. There is a check box list with every tag in the system, which controls the tags that should be represented within the folder. So, for example, one can choose to receive a folder for every tag except a few, a kind of blacklist. If the user wants to choose a kind of white list approach, this can be done by disabling the checkbox \emph{Automatically add new tags}. This way, when a new tag is added to the gallery, it will not be automatically enabled on the list, which is otherwise the default behavior.
