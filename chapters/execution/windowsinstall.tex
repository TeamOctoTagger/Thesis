\subsection{Windows installation}
\label{sub:mod:wininstall}
\def\kapitelautor{Christoph FÃ¼hrer}

On windows a batch file which runs the setup files for both OctoTagger and pywinlink has been created. This file was then converted into an executable (.exe) and made to run automatically with administrative privileges, due to the fact that the service creation needs those rights. When run, OctoTagger as well as the pywinlink module will be installed, the \emph{OctoTagger.exe} will be created and a shortcut on the desktop will be built. The application can now be started either via the executable in the installation folder or via the shortcut.
