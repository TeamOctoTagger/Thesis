\paragraph{Image preloading} is done to improve the user experience since every
time a new picture has to be displayed it first needs to be loaded into memory
and then scaled to fit the frame perfectly. To improve loading times a ring
buffer is used. This buffer always has the current and the two neighbouring
images loaded in full size, so that when the user changes the image it is
already loaded.

Every field in the buffer has a reference to a thread which loads the image.
When the image is changed the ring buffer is rotated to mark the next or
previous field, depending on user input, as the new current field. During this
the field opposite to the current is rotated over the ``edge'' of the ring
buffer, it moves from furthest back to furthest ahead or vice versa. This field
is invalidated, loaded with the information about the correct image and its
thread is started.
