The settings menu, which can be found in the file menu, is a custom dialogue window (\tfcode{wx.Dialogue)}, and provides five options to the user. With \emph{Default gallery folder} and \emph{Default folder location} the user can specify specific paths that should automatically be filled in when a gallery folder or advanced output folder is created. \emph{Default linking method} defines whether hardlinks or softlinks are used by default. \emph{Import method} sets whether files are copied or moved during import, and with \emph{Color theme} the user can choose the preferred theme of the user interface, bright or dark.

The implementation is very simple. On load, the current settings are loaded into the input fields, and saving causes the input to be checked for validity and subsequently written into the database.
