I have learned quite a lot about the pitfalls a project can have while working
on OctoTagger. The most important aspect, to me at least, is the continuous
ensurance of quality. Defining a small set of absolutely mandatory goals at the
beginning that capture the vision of the project, creating a functional
prototype that tests all requirements and writing automated tests to prevent
regressions from happening.

Having a clear vision from the start discourages implementing features which do
not align with this vision. We did not have such a fixed vision and I noticed
from time to time newly implemented features that seemed a bit out of place
because everyone had their own idea of what the software should do. The source
code as well should be structured so that it represents the vision resulting
in a module tree that represents how the product functions. For OctoTagger we
did not define a module layout and now we have just a bunch of files that are
difficult to manage.

Each external technology a program uses can break in unexpected ways. For this
reason a prototype is crafted, to see if all technologies really do solve our
problems instead of introducing new ones. I always though a prototype only has
to test functionality but there is one more aspect it must have: it must fulfill
all the requirements of the project. For OctoTagger a prototype showing that
managing tagged files is possible was created but some assumptions, mainly about
symlinks on Windows, were made that have not been clearly defined in the
contract. Had we not made assumptions here we would have saved a lot of time.

During development bugs appeared, which we anticipated, but as we neared
project completion fixing bugs became more difficult due to everything being
fragile. Fixing one bug resulted in breaking multiple other, previously working
parts of the software. Most of these regression bugs were in the frontend
because none of us are experts in wxWidgets but it nontheless showed me the
importance of pinning down correct behaviour with a test.

I have learned a lot about how fragile a project, especially a software project, can be. Small misconceptions between team members and their vision about the final product can be followed by severe consequences. While every member of the team had a similar idea of how OctoTagger should look like in the end, everyone still had some different opinions, concepts and ways of how we should proceed to the implementation. This could be reasoned by saying that we lacked an accurate planning. It could also be said that we did not communicate enough about how everybody wanted the end product to look like. While this is partly true from my perspective, I also believe that we just had a lack in the amount of research we did in the summer. Furthermore, everybody researched something else and we did not compare appropriately what has been found out. So when we started developing the software everybody was on a different level of knowledge and generally just not on equal ground. This is where many of the misconceptions came from in my opinion.  

Doing an extensive amount of research is just that important, especially when working with technologies completely unfamiliar to someone (In our case: Python, wxWidgets, PIL,\ldots). I cannot even imagine how much of a better planning phase we could have had if we had just added a few hours of research and comparison to everybody's tasks. The Windows Symlink problem (chapter 4, Implementation, pywinlink) for example this task far exceeded our expectation and therefore was planned to take about a fifth of the time it eventually took us. This led to an unexpected shift of working time, tasks and a change of the whole module structure which could have been prevented by doing proper research. While this was probably the biggest case of lacking research there were multiple more scenarios where it could have helped by a tremendous amount.

All in all, a lack of research always goes hand in hand with a lack of experience. If one is experienced enough he does not have to research as much as one who is not. However, I do not believe that we were at fault for not being experienced enough. We chose to go a path where we had to learn ourselves a lot of new things. We knew that we had a deficiency of experience in many matters and that we would have to research a lot on our own. The fact that we neglected this a little bit gave us a lot of trouble which could have been prevented easily.

Furthermore, I learned that setting goals is extremely important. Not just setting goals for the team or the product but for yourself. While having a goal which has to be fulfilled at the end of the task, like a definition of done, is a necessary thing too, it is not the only goal that should be set in my opinion. If one plans a clear goal of what he wants to have done at the end of a block of work, his efficiency will rise by a great amount. On the other hand, if one works on a task day for day without defining what he wants to be done after each block of work he will not feel satisfied with what he has done until the whole task is eventually finished. Having a clear vision of what you want to achieve at the end of the day can help making the work so much more efficient, effective and entertaining.
