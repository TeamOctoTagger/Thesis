\subsection{Overview}

Quality management includes activities to ensure the overall quality of a product and its implementation through means such as quality planning and quality assurance. 

Quality planning describes the process of defining measurable objectives and requirements that are important for a project. 

Quality assurance is used to control the implementation of these objectives and goals.

\subsection{QM activities for OctoTagger}

At the weekly sprint review meeting the developers discussed the found bugs and planned the fixing of them.

At the end of  the development a formalized test has been performed. For this purpose a test plan has been created which describes every activity that can be executed by the user.

Each test described in the test plan consists of the following fields: 

\begin{itemize}
\item test number
\item initial situation
\item user interface area (menu, main window, title bar, file-icon..)
\item action to be performed
\item final situation and number of the following test
\item expected outcome
\end{itemize}

After performing the test plan, the results have been recorded in the test protocol. The test protocol contains the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
\item test number
\item actual outcome
\item comments (e.g. error messages) 
\end{itemize}
