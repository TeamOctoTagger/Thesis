Sometimes it makes sense to catigorize files by different criteria so you have to copy the same file to different directories. However, saving files in more than one location at the same time is not recommended because if you change a file, it's hard to synchronise all the different copies.  Additionally, you need more disc space than necessary.

OctoTagger offers a solution for this problem. The basic feature of this software is to add tags to files and provide access to those files filtered by the attached tags. 

Different folder are created for each tag or combination of different tags and with the help of symbolic links the tagged files can be accessed from those folders without saving them multiple times.

The tags can be managed easily through the OctoTagger User Interface, but the software doesn't have to run to get access to the tagged files.
