\subsection{New gallery}

This dialogue can be opened via the file menu, and is used to create a new gallery. Its implementation is very straightforward. It asks for a name and path, and should the input be valid, the appropriate functions in the \tfcode{database} module are called: \tfcode{create_gallery} and \tfcode{switch_gallery}, in order to open it immediately. Should a it have been configured, the specified default gallery path in the settings is written into the folder path input field on creation of the window.
