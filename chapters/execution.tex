\subsection{Python}
As for the programming language we chose Python, Python 2.7 to be precise. We made that choice even though we did not learn it in school or any other extracurricular activity, so you may ask yourself: ``Why did you use it then? And why Python and not any other programming language?'' Well, one of our main goals of this project was to learn something new and since we have already been learning Java for three years in school we were easily able to cross that out. The other two languages which caught our interest were C++ and Python. Since we were not able to decide this without further investigation we had to research immensely and here are the key points for and against the two different languages we came up with to help us with the final decision:


\begin{itemize}
	\item Python is at a higher level and has a cleaner syntax than C++ which will probably lead to better code quality, less traps during development and debugging will be easier.
	\item Both Python and C++ are object oriented. C++ however introduces many new concepts, like pointers for example, which can be difficult to understand and are hard to master. Everything in Python seems pretty familiar however and we did not find anything that could hinder our coding process drastically.
	\item Python is interpreted and C++ is compiled, which means that C++ will have better performance and will also be easier to deploy since no runtime is needed on the client PC\@. The performance loss with Python can be ignored due to the fact that we are not doing any real-time computing and that it is just a quite small drop. For deployment there exist multiple solutions which are also easy to implement and depict no severe problems.
	\item Both Python and C++ have great IDEs for every platform, and the GUI-frameworks \emph{Qt} and \emph{wxWidgets} both have bindings for Python. C++ development on Windows is a bit tricky to set up, but only has to be done once.
\end{itemize}

After a long discussion we made the decision to use Python because there are just too many disadvantages when using C++ in contrast to the small amount of advantages it delivers compared to Python. The Syntax of Python also seemed a lot more pleasant to us than it did when looking at C++.

So the last step was to check if Python was not suitable for our type of application, therefore we had to do another round of research. After doing so, we came up with that it is hard to think of kinds of general applications where Python would be unsuitable, but there are several types where, like just about many other higher-level languages similar to it, it might be considered a peculiar and probably inferior choice.

In ``hard real time'' applications, all dynamic memory allocation and freeing, and especially garbage collection, are quite frowned upon. This rules out almost all modern languages (including Python, Java, C-Sharp,\ldots{}).

When programming for an ``embedded device'' which you expect to be produced and sold in huge numbers, every bit of ROM may add measurably to the overall costs, so you want a language focused on squeezing the application down to the last possible bit. Any language that relies on a rich supporting runtime environment or operating system would force you to spend extra money on more bits of ROM\@.

There are a lot of other kinds of applications that share similar constraints (monstly focused on memory) where the same case would apply again and again. Since none of the above mentioned categories apply and we can bear to have a small amount of ``excess'' data we are fine using Python.

\subsection{wxPython}
We had the idea to make the whole program as native as possible and to accomplish that we decided to use a cross-platform GUI framework because it offers a platform specific look with the same code for all platforms. That means that elements in Octotagger look just like they do in programs coming from your operating system. The reason for that is because the user has grown familiar to these elements. Nothing is strange to him about these objects and he likes seeing them because that is probably one of the reasons why he chose that operating system at first.

We want to give the user the impression that he is using an application which feels like it is coming directly from the operating system, as if it is already embedded from the start. The user should get the experience that there is not even a third party involved. He should get the feeling that our application is just an extension to his basic file manager, an enhancement which is easy to use and simplifies his file management.

The two main frameworks we researched were PyQt and wxPython. Both are really powerful frameworks that provide more than just a GUI\@. Qt, with its commercial background, has more features than wxWidgets, but is also more complex. The setup is about equal for both, so for us it just comes down to which one is easier to code in. But before deciding we agreed to compare the two frameworks, so we would have an easier time determining which one we would eventually use. This is what we came up with:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Both Qt and wxWidgets have many non-GUI-related classes, such as date/time, containers, networking and OpenGL functionality.
	\item Qt4.5 is available on MS Windows, Mac, and GNU/Linux under the LGPL and under a commercial license. All ports of wxWidgets are distributed under a permissive modified (but explicitly OSI-approved) LGPL, which allows development and distribution of proprietary applications without license costs.
	\item Qt doesn't have true native ports like wxWidgets does. Qt does not use system provided widgets, but emulates it with themes. What is meant by this is that even though Qt draws them quite realistically, Qt draws its own widgets on each platform. It's worth mentioning though that Qt comes with special styles for Mac OS X and MS Windows XP and Vista that use native APIs (Appeareance Manager on Mac OS X, UxTheme on Windows XP) for drawing standard widget primitives (e.g.\ scrollbars or buttons) exactly like any native application.
	\item They both offer numerous IDEs.
	\item Qt extends the C++ language with the MOC (Meta Object Compiler) to provide additional features like signal-slots. An advantage is the accuracy of signal-slot event processing; a disadvantage is that this invades your build system and makes use of non-standard language features\@. wxWidgets does not extend the C++ language and as such might be less intrusive to the build system or less surprising to developers expecting standard C++.
\end{itemize}

At this point we were not reluctant to use either wxWidgets or PyQt but we liked wx a little bit more. Therefore we made the decision to build a primitive prototype of the GUI and if we had ran into any problems or disliked coding with wxWidgets overall we would have taken another look at Qt. Since we had no major concerns we kept working with wxWidgets.

\subsection{PIL}
The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. This library supports many file formats, and provides powerful image processing and graphics capabilities. The decision of which image handling tool we would use was really simple and proceeded pretty much without any discussion. PIL is the standard tool for handling these things and there are not many other viable choices. And since we already had experience with this library from school the choice was obvious.

\subsection{Management tools}
At first we started using Trello to manage and to keep track of our tasks. Therefore we  utilized a time tracking tool with Trello integration called Punchtime to keep an eye on our working times. It offers a broad quantity of statistics and charts, which are easy to read and quickly deliver a great amount of information to the user. However we found the usage to be a bit clumsy and disliked the tool overall, same goes for Trello.

At the same time we were also using Taiga which is a project management platform for agile projects. That was the first tool we found really pleasant and easy to work with, and while it did nearly everything we wanted it to be capable off, we thought that it was not possible to assign tasks the way we wanted it. In the first sprint however we noticed that it was actually possible and so we saw no more reasons to keep using Trello in combination with Punchtime, so we dumped both. The only tool missing now was a time tracking application. We stumbled upon a few of these but the only one really catching our interest was Toggl. It is a great tool to keep an eye on your working time, gather information on how you compare to other team members and how much the entire team has been doing working the course of the project. Also it is extremely easy to work with and we all found it likeable right from the beginning.

So all in all we kept working with Taiga and Toggl for the entire project.

\section{Planning and Prototyping} % PoC
\def\kapitelautor{Erik Ritschl}

Our work already began in the summer of 2015. Since Python was a new language
to all of us, and we had little experience with GUI programming in general,
particularly with wxPython\index{wxPython}, we decided this was the best time
to acquaint ourselves with these topics. So we read and watched many tutorials
on the Internet, until we felt comfortable about carrying out a project with
these technologies.

A mini-prototype was also created, as a proof of concept. It had a very
minimalistic graphical user interface, ran only under Linux and was capable of
the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Read tags from a database file
	\item Read relations between tags and files
	\item Create folders for tags
	\item Create symbolic links in these folders that point to the according file
\end{itemize}

Up until this point a feature was planned, a must-requirement, that had to be
dropped. The software was supposed to be able to save tags not only in the
central database file, but also in the meta information of the file itself.
Attempts have been made at implementing this functionality, first with EXIF,
then IPTC and lastly XMP (all different kinds of meta data, where the first two
only work with images and the last one with all files). But it quickly became
evident during development of the prototype that there is no easy way to modify
meta data with Python on all the platforms that we support (Windows, OS X and
Ubuntu).

It was also tested whether symbolic links can be created with Python under
Windows. It was found that it is possible, but requires administrator
privileges. At that point it was thought that there is a relatively easy
workaround for this issue, but it later turned out that this was not the case.
You can read more about this in the ``Challenges'' section. % TODO: link

After the summer holidays had ended, the team sat together and decided upon the
exact features the software should have. These were then formulated as user
stories and together composed the product backlog. Soon after that, a method
called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker}{Planning Poker} was
used in order to decide how many points each user story should be assigned.
These points are used to describe the complexity of a user story, and help
estimating the total time a task needs in order to be completed.

With the completion of the product backlog, the next logical step was to
develop a paper prototype. A section of the frontend was assigned to each team
member, who subsequently drew sketches with a pen and paper. These were then
discussed with the team, and the process was repeated until everyone was happy
with the end result, the most important parts of which can be found below.

% TODO: Better picture
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pp_01}
	\caption{Sketch of the user interface}
\end{figure}

This sketch shows the general structure of the user interface, which is
consistent across every stage and mode of the software. It can be divided into
the following four sections:

\paragraph{Menu bar} This element can be found in almost all desktop
applications. For OctoTagger, four menus were chosen, \emph{File},
\emph{Tools}, \emph{View} and \emph{Help}. The file menu can be used to switch
and create galleries, import files and access the settings. With \emph{Tools}, the
user can start the \emph{tagging mode}, refresh thumbnails, reset or delete the
current gallery, restore all files, and perform a consistency check.  The \emph{View}
menu can be used to access the \emph{folder mode} and to choose, whether all,
tagged, or untagged files should be shown. The \emph{Help} menu can open the \emph{About}
dialog box as well as the user manual.

\paragraph{Main panel} This is the largest area of the user interface. Its content
depends on the current mode. For example, in \emph{overview mode}, the default,
all imported files are displayed. The items can be selected in order to perform
operations on them (such as renaming, deleting, and assigning tags). Selecting
items works the same way as in a standard file manager, so shortcuts
such as Shift+Click and Ctrl+A can be used. % TODO: Style shortcuts

\paragraph{Tag panel} The first element in the top left box is a text field. It
has two different functions: \emph{assigning tags} and \emph{filtering}.  When
one or more files in the main panel is selected, one can enter a tag name in
the text field and press enter. This tag is then assigned to the selected
files, and the tag will be created if it does not already exist. When no files
are selected, the text field can be used to enter \emph{expressions}, such as
``school'' (all files with the tag ``school'') or ``school -htl'' (all items
with the tag ``school'' but without ``htl''). This has the effect that only
items that match the expression are displayed in the main panel.

Below the text field is a list of every tag, with a checkbox and the tag name.
When a file is selected, the corresponding tags are checked. They can be
manually checked and unchecked, in order to add or remove tags. When multiple
files are selected, shared tags are checked, and tags that are assigned to some
but not all of the items are put into the ``third state'', indicating partial
applicability. This state is usually illustrated as a square, but it can depend
on the platform. In the case that no files are currently selected, checking a
tag causes the tag name to be entered into the text field, which leads to the
filtering described above. This also works with multiple tags.

\paragraph{Context panel} The last section is located in the bottom left box.
The context panel includes several buttons for performing different actions,
depending on the context. It can, for example, delete the currently selected
files, or open them in an image viewer. The idea here is that it shows all the
actions that are available in the context menu (which appears with right
clicking the main panel), but makes them much more visible. This way, users are
much more likely to find and use them.

\paragraph{}
Another feature worth mentioning here is the \emph{tagging view} (or
\emph{tagging mode}), pictured below. % TODO better reference to picture

% TODO: Better picture
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pp_02}
	\caption{Sketch of the tagging view}
\end{figure}

There are several ways to start this mode. It can be done by double clicking
an item in overview mode, selecting \emph{Start tagging mode} in the
\emph{Tools} menu, or by pressing the according button in the \emph{context pane}.

In this mode, only a single item is visible at a time.
When it is an image file, the image is displayed as big as
possible, and if not, a generic icon is used instead. This mode can be used to
go through a larger collection of photos, look at the content of each one, and
decide which tags apply. The tag and context panes behave the same way as
when a single item in the overview mode is selected.

\section{Structure}
\def\kapitelautor{Clemens Stadlbauer}

In our code repository there are several folders, each of which contains a
certain category of files.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[\tfpath{doc/}] The documentation of the software, i.e.~the user manual
	\item[\tfpath{icons/}] All the different icons and the logo used throughout the software
	\item[\tfpath{db/}] Database schemas and the database setup script
	\item[\tfpath{src/}] The actual code of the software
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Database}

% TODO ER-Model

\tfpath{system.sql} contains the schema of the main database which in turn
contains the user settings and the location of all galleries.
\Cref{lst:db:system} on \cpageref{lst:db:system} shows the entire schema. When
the program is started for the first time these tables are filled with the
following default values.

\begin{table}[!h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lr}
		\toprule
		\multicolumn{2}{c}{gallery} \\
		\midrule
		\tfcode{name} & \mintinline{sql}{'default'} \\
		\tfcode{location} & \mintinline{sql}{'.'} \\
		\toprule
		\multicolumn{2}{c}{settings} \\
		\midrule
		\tfcode{default_gallery_path} & \mintinline{sql}{'.'} \\
		\tfcode{default_folder_path} & \mintinline{sql}{''} \\
		\tfcode{use_softlink} & \mintinline{sql}{TRUE} \\
		\tfcode{import_copy} & \mintinline{sql}{TRUE} \\
		\tfcode{use_dark_theme} & \mintinline{sql}{TRUE} \\
		\tfcode{current_db} & \mintinline{sql}{TRUE} \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Default settings}
\end{table}

Every gallery has its own database as described in \tfpath{gallery.sql}
containing all imported files, all created tags and all created output folders.
The connections between these items (for example which tags a file has) are
recorded in intermediate tables. \Cref{lst:db:gallery} in
\cpageref{lst:db:gallery} shows the entire schema.

Furthermore, the directory contains the helper script \tfpath{setup.py} to
create the initial system database and an empty gallery database which is
copied every time a new gallery is created by the user.

\begin{listing}[!ht]
	\begin{minted}{sql}
		CREATE TABLE gallery (
			pk_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
			name TEXT,
			location TEXT
		);

		CREATE TABLE settings (
			pk_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
			default_gallery_path TEXT,
			default_folder_path TEXT,
			use_softlink BOOLEAN,
			import_copy BOOLEAN,
			use_dark_theme BOOLEAN,
			current_db INTEGER REFERENCES gallery(pk_id)
		);
	\end{minted}

			file_name TEXT
		);

		CREATE TABLE file_has_tag (
			pk_fk_file_id INTEGER REFERENCES file(pk_id),
			pk_fk_tag_id INTEGER REFERENCES tags(pk_id),
			amount INTEGER
		);

\end{listing}

\subsection{Source}
Herein lie all the modules that make up the entirety of the functionality and
design of OctoTagger. Each module is contained in a single file with the
module's name and can be categorizes as either frontend or backend. All the
frontend modules provide some part of the user interface while all the backend
modules implement mostly all the functionality that happens in the background
(for example the management of files). The main file is \tfpath{octotagger.py},
which is used to start the program.
