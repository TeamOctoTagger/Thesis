\section{Structure}
\def \kapitelautor {Clemens Stadlbauer}

In our code repository there are several folders, each of which containing a
certain category of files.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[\tfpath{doc/}] The documentation of the software, i.e. the user manual
	\item[\tfpath{icons/}] All the different icons and the logo used throughout the
	software
	\item[\tfpath{db/}] Database schemas and the database setup script
	\item[\tfpath{src/}] The actual code of the software
\end{itemize}

\subsection{db}
In \tfpath{system.sql} is the schema of the main database. It contains the user
settings and the location of all the galleries. Every gallery has its own
database as described in \tfpath{gallery.sql} containing all imported files,
all created tags and all created output folders. The connections between these
items (for example which tags a files has) are recorded in addition,
intermediate tables.

Furthermore, the directory contains a helper script to create the initial
system database and an empty gallery database which is copied every time a new
gallery is created by the user.

\subsection{src}
Herein lie all the modules that make up the entirety of the functionality and
design of OctoTagger. Each module is contained in a single file with the
module's name and can be categorizes as either frontend or backend. All the
frontend modules provide some part of the user interface while all the backend
modules implement mostly all the functionality that happens in the background
(for example the management of files).
