\subsection{import\_files}

This is the backend module for importing files into the currently active gallery, but it also contains some frontend elements.

It only has a single function, \tfcode{import\_files}, which takes either a list of file paths or a python dictionary, where file paths are the keys and lists of tags the values, as its argument. The former option corresponds to a ``Direct file import'', and the latter to an import via the more complex and powerful import mode.

In both cases, the given data the is being iterated over, and a number of procedures are executed for each file. First, a check is made to ensure that the file actually exists. Then, a random unique ID gets generated, in form of an UUID. The file is then either moved or copied (a preference which can be set in the settings) to the \tfcode{files} folder in the gallery, using the UUID as its name. This is necessary to avoid name conflicts, since all files are located in the same directory. Finally, an entry is made in the database, saving the file's UUID as well as its original name. When a dictionary with tags was passed over, the tag relations are also made here.

As mentioned earlier, there are also some frontend elements. These consist of pop ups that inform the user of any errors that occurred during the import, as well as a progress bar which shows how many files have yet to be imported. There is also an informational pop up at the end that warns the user about any files that have the same name. Same name files supported by OctoTagger in principal, but there are some not easily avoidable inconsistencies that come with them. It was therefore decided to warn the user about the potential issues and urging him or her to change the file names.
