This panel is located below the tag list, and contains a dynamic list of
buttons for performing various actions. It also extends
\tfcode{wx.ScrolledWindow} \cite{wxScrolledWindow}, which makes it scrollable. The list is updated via
the method \tfcode{SetMode}, which takes the software mode and amount of
selected items (none, single or multiple items) as arguments. Most buttons are
directly bound to functions in \tfcode{octotagger.py} (e.g.
\tfcode{RemoveItem}).
