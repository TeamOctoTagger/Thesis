This module provides the functionality for exporting and restoring files. This is necessary since imported files are located in a program directory that should not be accessed by the user under normal circumstances. Both \emph{Export} and \emph{Restore} copy one or more of the imported files to a specified location, with the difference that restoring also completely removes the files from the database. This way, users are able to regain regular control of their files, should they decide that OctoTagger is no longer suitable for organizing them.

%TODO actually implement described functionality
