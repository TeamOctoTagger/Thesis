\subsection{\tfcode{integrity}}
\def\kapitelautor{Clemens Stadlbauer}

\subsubsection{Abstract}

This modules checks if a gallery's database became out of sync with the file
system at some point. The \tfcode{check} method updates all output folders and
informs the user of missing or extra files in the gallery.

\subsubsection{Attempts}

Early during development, even before gallery output folders existed, an
incomplete version of the integrity check existed which only updated output
folders. Development was moved to other, more important parts of OctoTagger
until towards the end of development this module was completely redone with all
the new features in mind.

\subsubsection{Solution} % TODO better title

The functionality can be split into three parts: gallery output folders,
advanced output folders and the gallery source folder. For all output folders
missing files are created. Gallery output folders have the additional check if
folders for each associated tag are present.

The gallery source folders are handled more carefully because the user is
expected not to interact with it meaning discrepancies could be the result of
an unknown error from the user. Because of this no files are modified or
deleted, instead the user is informed.
