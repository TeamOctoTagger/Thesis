\subsection{ItemView}

\subsubsection{Abstract}
This module lays out a list of items consisting of a thumbnail and a name in a
grid with room to grow off the bottom of the frame. The thumbnails are loaded
in a background thread to make the interface immediately available to the user.

\subsubsection{Attempts}
The original idea was to have a \tfcode{GridSizer} and a rough size for each
item. The number of items per row would have been calculated based on the size
of the containing frame. The problem with this attempt is that quite many
expensive operations and calculations would have to be done on every resize,
potentially resulting in a degraded user experience along with a cluttered
codebase. For this reason a simpler and more elegant solution was searched.

Due to a lack of knowledge on the available \tfcode{Sizers} in wxWidgets the
strategy was to basically try out every one and analyse it. There always were
some problems or limitations with the used \tfcode{Sizers}, until the
\tfcode{WrapSizer} was discovered.

The only problem with this sizer is that it grows off to the right by default
and there seemed to be no way to tell it to grow off the bottom. After trying
to limit the available vertical space of the sizer with no success, it was
placed inside a \tfcode{ScrolledWindow} and after figuring out how to properly
set the size of this window the solution was found.

\subsubsection{Solution} % TODO better title

Every item is given a fixed size and placed inside the \tfcode{WrapSizer}
